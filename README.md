# INN-Hotels
Project: Analyze the data of INN Hotels to find which factors have a high influence on booking cancellations, build a predictive model that can predict which booking is going to be canceled in advance, and help in formulating profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.

# Skills and Tools Covered
EDA, data preprocessing, logistic regression, multicollinearity, AUC-ROC curve, precision-recall curve, decision tree, pre-pruning, cost-complexity pruning

# My Learnings
This was a comprehensive project that encompassed the training of decision tree models, and logistic regression models. It was interesting to see how ROC-AUC and precision-recall curves can help determine the optimal threshold value for logistic regression. In addition, it was insightful to compare the performances of the base decision tree model, pre-pruned decision tree model and the cost-complexity model. After careful analysis, a profile of hotel bookings likely to be canceled was identified, along with strategies to encourage customer return.
